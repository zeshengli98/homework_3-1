##### FA Accounts #####
# If you're a financial advisor (FA) then you're not finished creating your
# orders at this point because you need to answer the question: which account
# would you like to place the order on? All of them? Just one? Several? There
# are a few ways to do this, for example, by using GROUPS: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/advisors/topics/accountgroups.htm
# But probably the easiest way is to just pass in the ID of the account you
# want to use, like this:
mkt_order.account = 'DU1267861'
lmt_order.account = 'DU1267861'
# Don't want to mess this one up because your clients all signed up for
# different strategies. You don't want to accidentally make trades for your
# wild options strategy using the account owned by your conservative, careful
# client who only trades index funds and dividend-paying stocks in the SP500!

# Place orders!
# order_response_stk_lmt = place_order(contract_stk, lmt_order)
order_response_cp_mkt = place_order(contract_cp, mkt_order)
order_response_crypto_mkt = place_order(contract_crypto, mkt_order)

# Print the info returned by placing orders:
# print(order_response_stk_lmt)
print(order_response_crypto_mkt)
print(order_response_cp_mkt)

# You can select what you want from the response, for example:
print(order_response_cp_mkt['perm_id'])
